reachability test applied

non monotonic heuristic:
nodes are moved from closed list to open list

monotonic heuristic :
nodes are not moved from closed list to open list

test case
6 4 7 5 0 8 1 2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0

monotonic admissible (manhattan):
nodes expanded : 8846
length of path found : 30

nonmonotonic admissible :
nodes expanded : 6184
length of path found : 30

nonmonotonic nonadmissible :
nodes expanded : 483
length of path found : 70


comparison of unidirection and bidirection
6 4 7 5 0 8 1 2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0

for manhattan heuristic
nodes expanded in unidirection : 8846
nodes expanded in bidirection  : 2282

for no heuristic
nodes expanded in unidirection : 180000
nodes expanded in bidirection  : 2800
